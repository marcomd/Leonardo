Description:
    en: Customized version of rails's scaffold, to be used after leolay.
    it: Versione personalizzata dello scaffold di rails, da usare dopo leolay.

    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'rails destroy scaffold ModelName'.

Use after leolay:
    1. rails generate leolay
    2. rails generate leosca

Usage example:
    rails generate leosca product name:string description:text active:boolean items:integer price:decimal

    Available options:
    rails generate leosca product name:string --skip-remote       => if you do not want ajax
    rails generate leosca product name:string --skip-seeds
    rails generate leosca product name:string --seeds=60          => if you need more records

    Of course, these options are in addition to those provided by the original scaffold
